# Project Sigma

## Name

The Name is just the S letter in the Greek Alphabet so its short for Stalker and has nothing to do with the memes.

## Features

- The Script runs every 5 mins stalking an Instagram profile (specified by the user) and logging the number of posts, followers and the number of account he/she follows and logs all this info in a CSV file

## How to Use

1. You will need Python installed on your computer already
2. Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KoshariDotEXE/ProjectSigma
    ```
    
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd ProjectSigma
    ```
    
4. Download the latest version of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and place the `geckodriver.exe` file in the same directory as `main.py` and `sigma.py`
5. Run `main.py`
    
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    
6. If you want to exit the script **`CTRL + C`** does the trick
