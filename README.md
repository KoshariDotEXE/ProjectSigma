# Project Sigma

## Name

The Name is just the S letter in the Greek Alphabet so its short for Stalker and has nothing to do with the memes.

## Features

- The Script runs every 5 mins stalking an Instagram profile (specified by the user) and logging the number of posts, followers and the number of account he/she follows and logs all this info in a CSV file

## How to Use

- You will need Python installed on your computer already
- Download the latest version of Firefox and geckodriver and place the `geckodriver.exe` file in the same directory as `main.py` and `sigma.py`
- Run `main.py`
- If you want to exit the script **`CTRL + C`** does the trick
